<a href="feb05/">February 5</a> - Cryptogram Tools - Uses PERL for the encryption, and PHP for the decryption tools.  Uses Javascript for some minor tools. - The "Encrypt" page takes as argument a plaintext and a 26-character cipher to user for the encryption.  This can be generated randomly by Javascript.  Pressing the "Encode" button will translate the text, retaining cases, and leaving any punctuation, numbers, etc. unchanged.  The "Decoding Tools" page takes a cryptogram as argument.  It will display a letter distribution for the page text, along with a list of one to four letter words in the text sample.  Some useful solving tips are included as well.<br><br>

<a href="feb07/">February 7</a> - Mandelbrot Viewer - Uses PHP, Perl, and C to create images (with GD), PHP for navigation pages - There are three separate pages which can create images of the Mandelbrot set.  As performance is an order of magnitude better using C, the zoomable version of the Mandelbrot set is written in C.  It loops colors after 48 iterations, and you can change the size of the image or increase the iteration count.  You can also click on the image to zoom in on that point.<br><br>

<a href="feb10/">February 10</a> - Compound Interest Calculator - Uses only Javascript - Calculates amount based on principal, interest rate, and time period.<br><br>

<a href="feb11/">February 11</a> - Flash Card - Uses PHP and mySQL - Select one of the three flash card sets.  A random entry is selected and one of the fields designated as "unique" for that set will display. (For example, for a math problem, the problem is unique but the answer is not.  For Chinese-English translation, both languages would be unique.). Clicking "View Solution" will display all the other information associated with the card.  You can also select the level for the problem you want.  New data sets or entries can be added relatively easily with only mySQL queries.  A tool to add words to the Chinese Vocabulary dataset is linked.<br><br>

<a href="feb13/">February 13</a> - Numerical Evaluator - Uses PERL - Parses a mathematical expression containing numerical values, +-*/, and parentheses.  Displays the steps taken in order to evaluate the expression, and prints the result.  <br><br>

<a href="feb17/">February 17</a> - Stock Price Tools - Uses PHP and mySQL - Displays a chart with the stock prices for any S&P 500 stock from Dec 23, 2005 to Feb 16, 2007.<br><br>

<a href="feb18/">February 18</a> - Web Board - Uses PHP/mySQL - You can enter your name, a comment title, and a comment.  Functions more like a guest book, as there is no capacity for threaded comments.  You can go back and forward to view 20 entries at a time, or link to a single entry.  Also includes an RSS feed of the information.<br><br>

<a href="feb20/">February 20</a> - CAPTCHA Generator - Uses PHP - Type your text into the box, and a CAPTCHA based on that text will be generated.  The CAPTCHA uses several anti-OCR techniques including variable placement of characters, variable color of characters, random rows of pixels being shifted horizontally, random rows of pixels being inverted, and random rows of pixels being erased.<br><br>

<a href="feb23/">February 23</a> - Vignere Cypher Generator - Uses PERL - Encrypts a text using a given cipher.<br><br>

<a href="feb25/">February 25</a> - Unit Converter - Uses JavaScript - Converts between various units of length, volume, and mass.<br><br>

<a href="feb26/">February 26</a> - Random Data Generator - Uses PHP - Generates a CSV list containing random integers, decimals, or character strings of type selected by the user.<br><br>
