<a href="index.php">Month of Code Home</a><br><br>

<a href="feb04/">February 4</a> - Color Picker - Uses JavaScript to update the image, and PHP to generate the image with the desired colors - Enter a hex-color code for the background, text, and field.  A "Flag" designed in honor of the Super Bowl, with a football field, endposts, and the words "Colts" and "Bears" will be automatically updated with your color selections.<br><br>

<a href="feb05/">February 5</a> - Cryptogram Tools - Uses PERL for the encryption, and PHP for the decryption tools.  Uses Javascript for some minor tools. - The "Encrypt" page takes as argument a plaintext and a 26-character cipher to user for the encryption.  This can be generated randomly by Javascript.  Pressing the "Encode" button will translate the text, retaining cases, and leaving any punctuation, numbers, etc. unchanged.  The "Decoding Tools" page takes a cryptogram as argument.  It will display a letter distribution for the page text, along with a list of one to four letter words in the text sample.  Some useful solving tips are included as well.<br><br>

<a href="feb06/">February 6</a> - Hunt the Wumble - Uses PHP and AJAX - After entering your name, you are placed in the dungeon of the wumble, with two rounds of ammunition.  You must traverse the dungeon and attempt to shoot the mysterious wumble.  Don't walk into its lair or the wumble will flee the dungeon! (Do not confuse this with the similar Hunt the Wumpus game.)<br><br>

<a href="feb07/">February 7</a> - Mandelbrot Viewer - Uses PHP, Perl, and C to create images (with GD), PHP for navigation pages - There are three separate pages which can create images of the Mandelbrot set.  As performance is an order of magnitude better using C, the zoomable version of the Mandelbrot set is written in C.  It loops colors after 48 iterations, and you can change the size of the image or increase the iteration count.  You can also click on the image to zoom in on that point.<br><br>

<a href="feb09/">February 9</a> - Word Problems - Uses AJAX and PHP back-end -  Automatically generates one of 6 different types of word problems.<br><br>

<a href="feb11/">February 11</a> - Flash Card - Uses PHP and mySQL - Select one of the three flash card sets.  A random entry is selected and one of the fields designated as "unique" for that set will display. (For example, for a math problem, the problem is unique but the answer is not.  For Chinese-English translation, both languages would be unique.). Clicking "View Solution" will display all the other information associated with the card.  You can also select the level for the problem you want.  New data sets or entries can be added relatively easily with only mySQL queries.  A tool to add words to the Chinese Vocabulary dataset is linked.<br><br>

<a href="feb17/">February 17</a> - Stock Price Tools - Uses PHP and mySQL - Displays a chart with the stock prices for any S&P 500 stock from Dec 23, 2005 to Feb 16, 2007.<br><br>

<a href="feb18/">February 18</a> - Web Board - Uses PHP/mySQL - You can enter your name, a comment title, and a comment.  Functions more like a guest book, as there is no capacity for threaded comments.  You can go back and forward to view 20 entries at a time, or link to a single entry.  Also includes an RSS feed of the information.<br><br>

<a href="feb19/">February 19</a> - Metal Wars - Uses PHP and AJAX - Basically like Dope Wars, only with metals instead of drugs.  Try to beat $1000000 in just 30 days.<br><br>

<a href="feb20/">February 20</a> - CAPTCHA Generator - Uses PHP - Type your text into the box, and a CAPTCHA based on that text will be generated.  The CAPTCHA uses several anti-OCR techniques including variable placement of characters, variable color of characters, random rows of pixels being shifted horizontally, random rows of pixels being inverted, and random rows of pixels being erased.<br><br>

<a href="feb22/">February 22</a> - Beat the Clock - Uses Javascript and PHP - Pick a board size, and hit start.  Click on the numbers in order starting with 1 as fast as you can.  Try to beat the goal times.<br><br>

<a href="feb26/">February 26</a> - Random Data Generator - Uses PHP - Generates a CSV list containing random integers, decimals, or character strings of type selected by the user.<br><br>
