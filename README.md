# monthofcode

In February 2007, I did a "month of code" project where I wrote a small self-contained program every day.

8 years later, I'm setting this up on a proper source code repository.
It's kind of interesting how some things no longer work at all (Java applets), others
are mostly broken (anything involving databases), while a few still work perfectly
(the 75-line C program to make Mandlebrot images).  The choice of PHP instead of Python
looks especially strange 8 years out.
